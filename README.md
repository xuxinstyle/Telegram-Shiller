# Getting Started
Telegram auto sign in accounts, join channels and send messages periodically.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x.x
- Telethon
- Threading 
- asyncio
- Telebot token via website

### Installing
- You need to get your telegram ID and HASH in this website : [**CLÄ°CK**](https://my.telegram.org/auth).
- id0 = Shill("","","0",group0) First area is for ID and second area is for HASH. You can add bots how much you want but **Don't forget to add at the end of the lines to start**
- In message.py file you need to define **Telegram Groups** and your **Message**.

### Usage
There is 2 version of this bot. 1H is 1 Hour bot. It send message every 1hour to the groups that you define. Normal bot sends messages faster but you can get ban be careful. I recommend to add at least 5 bot for normal verion.
